#Range App
For now is just a simple SPA representing popular card game <i><b>'Shit happens'</b></i> in online mode.<br>
Your aim is to put cards in right order ranging them according to some param. 
The value of this param(pain, fun or smth else) is not fixed and depends on your own experience. 
So these values  are set according to players choices done before and are changing after every game.
This way value of every card represents real attitude of real people to this thing.<br>
May be it looks complicated but just start playing and it will became clear.
Have fun!
